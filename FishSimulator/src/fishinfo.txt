Fish tank chemistry info

pH:
* almost all freshwater fish inhabit waters with a pH from 5-9; majority in 6-7.5
* falls with decaying material (plant and animal wastes)
* when falls below 5.5, bacteria that break down ammonia die and ammonia level rises
* can be lowered using phosphate based chemicals, which encourages algae growth
* lowered by plants and fish during respiration
* difficult to lower in hard water
* raised by adding baking soda
* raised by water change
* lowered by agent like "pH Down"
* lowered by adding water of low pH during water changes

hardness:
* amount of dissolved minerals, especially calcium and magnesium
* usually expressed in amount of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
* measured in ppm and dH (degrees of hardness) or gH (general hardness)
* very soft = 0-70 ppm, 0-4 gH/dH
* soft = 70-135 ppm, 4-8 gH/dH
* medium hard = 135-200 ppm, 8-12 gH/dH
* hard = 200-350 ppm, 12-20 gH/dH
* very hard >350 ppm, >20 gH/dH
* softened by peat filtration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange resins, or boiling water
* hardened by filtering through dolomite or crushed coral
* very soft water subject to pH crashes
* can test by running electrical current through water; higher conductivity = higher hardness

dissolved gases
* dissolved oxygen in water necessary for respiration
* oxygen added through air pump, higher exposed surface area
* plants add oxygen in day with photosynthesis and use oxygen at night with respiration
* less oxygen present at higher temperature
* CO2 present as byproduct of respiration
* plants use CO2 during photosynthesis but produce CO2 during respiration
* low CO2 causes yellowing of plant leaves and slow growth
* CO2 prescence lowers pH and hardness
* too much CO2 harms fish
* Co2 can be added using CO2 system

Nitrogen cycle
* fish waste, uneaten food, dead plants or fish broken down into ammonia
* ammonium is present if pH<7 and is not toxic; ammonia present if pH>7 and is highly toxic
* levels of ammonia >2ppm very dangerous; rises by third day
* nitrosomonas bacteria grow which convert ammonia into nitrite, also highly toxic
* nitrite can be lethal at 1 mg/L; rises by end of first week
* nitrobacter bacteria convert nitrites to nitrates; not highly toxic at low levels
* partial water changes keep nitrate levels at safe range
* test for ammonia on day three, continue until reaches zero
* signs of fish distress: rapid breathing, clamped fins, erratic swimming, hanging at surface for air
* ammonia reduced quickly by chemicals like "ammo-lock"
* test for nitrites on day 7, continue until reaches zero
* if nitrate levels are high perform 25-50% water change
* during cycling, don't add fish, change filter media (bacteria grow there), overfeed fish, or alter pH (unless serious problem, as bacteria will be disturbed)
* changing water will slow bacteria growth but also lower ammonia and nitrite levels
* testing ammonia: if at >2ppm, or fish show signs of distress, perform 50% water change, chemically neutralize ammonia, lower pH below 7, withhold feedings
* if ammonia at 1-2ppm, perform 25-50% water change, reduce feedings by half, watch fish for distress
* if ammonia at .25-1ppm, perform 25% water change, reduce feedings by half
* ammonia below .25ppm good.
* testing nitrite: if at >1ppm or fish distressed, perform 50% water change, withhold feedings
* if nitrite at .5-1ppm, perform 25-50% water change, reduce feedings by half, add .5oz salt per 1 gall water, increase aeration
* if nitrite at .1-.5ppm, perform 25% water change, reduce feedings by half
* nitrite below .1ppm good
* water changes are the only way to reduce nitrites
* bacteria can die at pH below 5.5
